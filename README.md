# Kometa (Formerly Plex Meta Manager) setup for Monogatari
Example setup files and assets for customizing Monogatari metadata in Plex. Taken from https://github.com/zeekaran, and updated (hopefully) to work with Kometa instead of the older Plex Meta Manager. 

This is for running [Kometa](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager) and optionally with docker compose. Monogatari is notoriously disorganized and requires complicated guides to understand watch order if you depend on automatic matchers. It is arguably much better to set it up yourself, fully customized like so. Note that you will need to organize your files and folder structure to match, [like this](https://i.imgur.com/c5MXeaB.png).

Special thanks to Zeekaran for starting this little project, the Kometa devs for a great tool that does way more than I understand, and the Kometa discord support staff for helping me troubleshoot this to working status.

Will be updating with new assets for the currently airing 'Monogatari Series: Off & Monster Season' eventually.
