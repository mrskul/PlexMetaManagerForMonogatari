# Plex Meta Manager setup for Monogatari
My example setup files and assets for customizing Monogatari metadata in Plex.

This is for running [Plex-Meta-Manager](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager) and optionally with docker compose. Monogatari is notoriously disorganized and requires complicated guides to understand watch order if you depend on automatic matchers. It is arguably much better to set it up yourself, fully customized like so. Note that you will need to organize your files and folder structure to match, [like this](https://i.imgur.com/c5MXeaB.png).
